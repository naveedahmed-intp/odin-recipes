    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 poblano peppers</li>
        <li>5 ears corn, husks and silks removed</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce can) no-salt-added black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded pepper Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup pico de gallo</li>
        <li>cilantro leaves, lime wedges, and/or radish slices, for serving (optional)</li>
        <li>chili powder, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect grilling, lighting burners on just one side or pushing lit coals to one side. Preheat to medium-high heat (375 to 400 degrees F (180 to 200 degrees C)). Lightly oil grill grates over lit side.</li>
        <li>Grill poblanos and corn, covered, turning occasionally, until poblano skins and corn are charred, about 10 minutes. Keep grill lit.</li>
        <li>Transfer poblanos to a large bowl, cover, and let stand for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, let corn stand until cool enough to handle; cut kernels from cobs.</li>
        <li>Remove and discard poblano skins, keeping stems intact. Make a lengthwise slit down one side of each poblano, starting at stem and being careful not to cut through to other side. Remove and discard seeds and membranes.</li>
        <li>Stir together beans, corn kernels, cilantro, oregano, garlic, salt, cumin, and black pepper in a large bowl. Spoon about 1/2 cup bean mixture into each pepper, enclosing pepper around the filling.</li>
        <li>For the cheese sauce, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; whisk in flour. Cook, stirring until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in milk; simmer, stirring, until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually whisk in cheese until melted. Remove from heat and keep warm, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil grill grate over unlit side of grill. Grill stuffed poblanos, covered, until filling is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with cheese sauce; pico de gallo; and (if using) cilantro, lime wedges, and/or radishes. Garnish with chili powder.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook's Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>MAKE AHEAD: </strong>Prep recipe through Step 4. Chill, covered, up to 3 days. Grill as directed. We don’t recommend making the cheese sauce ahead of time.</li>
        <li><strong>VEGAN-IZE: </strong>Replace cheese sauce with vegan queso-style sauce (such as Good Foods, Mother Raw, or Siete).</li>
        <li><strong>MAKE IT MEATY: </strong>Add 8 ounces cooked Mexican chorizo to bean mixture in Step 5 and decrease salt to 1/2 teaspoon.</li>
    </ul>
